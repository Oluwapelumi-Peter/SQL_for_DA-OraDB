# SQL for Data Analysis Using Oracle DB Software



## Introduction


This is a practice data analysis project that sets out to analyze the data of a fictitious company using SQL in the Oracle Database software.
Divided into four parts, the project explores SQL data analysis concepts from basic in Part 1 all the way to complex in Part 4.
The data analysis concepts covered in the practice project includes

- the use of data definition language (DDL) to create tables and insert data into them

- exploration of tables within a database to understand the relationship between them

- displaying records in a particular order

- querying the database to reveal specific insights based on simple and complex nested conditions

- understanding the difference between the traditional and ANSI SQL code structure

## Methodology

This data analysis practice project was completed using SQL in Oracle Database software (Oracle Database 21c edition), the software is available on the official Oracle website.
After successful download and installation, SQL Plus was used to configure a database instance for the analysis project.
Next, a database connection was established with the database instance through SQL developer using the configuration parameters and credentials already created.
Tutorial and guide documents to get this done are available in the "Docs" folder.



Data for the practice project was created using SQL data definition language (DDL), Tables were created and records inserted into them. The script for this is available in the "Data" folder.

The analysis was done using SQL data manipulation language (DML) to draw specific insight based on both simple and complex nested conditions.
